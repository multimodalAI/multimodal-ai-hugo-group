The UK Open Multimodal AI Network (UKOMAIN) is committed to providing a respectful, inclusive, and safe environment for all participants in our events, including workshops, seminars, hackathons, meetings, and online activities (e.g. Microsoft Teams). 

We expect all attendees, organisers, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and community participants to behave professionally, treat one another with respect, and help us ensure a positive experience for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or experience.

This Code of Conduct applies primarily to in-person and virtual UKOMAIN events, but also extends to related communications and online community spaces managed by UKOMAIN, such as Microsoft Teams and GitHub discussions. Even if those platforms have their own codes of conduct, participants are expected to also follow this UKOMAIN Code of Conduct while engaging in UKOMAIN-managed spaces.

By participating in any UKOMAIN event or engaging in UKOMAIN-managed community spaces, you agree to adhere to the principles and expectations outlined below.

## Expected Conduct

We ask all participants to:

- Be kind, considerate, and respectful to others  
- Communicate in a constructive, inclusive, and professional manner  
- Respect the diversity of opinion, experience, and background  
- Support a collaborative, open, and welcoming atmosphere  
- Follow all event rules, instructions from organisers, and venue or platform guidelines  
- Be mindful of their surroundings and fellow participants  

This applies during all sessions, breaks, social activities, and online discussions (including video, audio, chat, collaborative platforms, and Microsoft Teams channels or messages).

## Unacceptable Conduct

Harassment and other inappropriate behaviour are not tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment or intimidation, including sustained disruption of talks or other events

- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviours  

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

## Virtual Participation

For virtual events, online meetings, or engagement in UKOMAIN-managed community platforms (such as Microsoft Teams or GitHub), participants are expected to:

- Use video, audio, chat, and comment functions appropriately and respectfully  
- Avoid impersonating others or misrepresenting identity  
- Refrain from posting or sharing unsolicited promotions, advertisements, or spam  
- Respect the flow of conversation and avoid dominating discussions
