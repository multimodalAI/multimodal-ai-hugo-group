### Welcome to the UK Open Multimodal AI Network

The UK Open Multimodal AI Network (UKOMAIN) is a national initiative funded by the [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/) with a total grant of Â£1.8 million. Our mission is to advance multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) by integrating diverse data typesâ€”such as text, images, and soundâ€”to tackle scientific and engineering challenges and create a sustainable future.

UKOMAIN connects researchers, industry partners, and policymakers across eight [Tomorrowâ€™s Engineering Research Challenges (TERCs)](https://www.ukri.org/publications/tomorrows-engineering-research-challenges/)â€”ranging from health and wellbeing, transportation systems, and robotics to materials discovery, space research, nature-based engineering, global engineering solutions, and responsible engineeringâ€”to foster collaboration, innovation, and real-world impact. Follow our [UKOMAIN LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ukomain) for the latest updates and opportunities or subscribe to our [Multimodal AI Community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/multimodal-ai-community-group).
