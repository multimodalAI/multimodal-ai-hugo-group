### 📸 Call for Entries: UKOMAIN Multimodal AI Photo Competition 2025

Are you ready to show the world what Multimodal AI “sees” — or what you see through your own lens?

As part of UKOMAIN’s mission to foster creative, inclusive, and community-driven engagement, we’re excited to launch the first UKOMAIN Multimodal AI Photo Competition — featuring two exciting tracks:

- #### AI Track – "Through the Eyes of the Machine"
Submit an AI-generated image that creatively explores themes of multimodal AI — such as engineering, sustainability, wellbeing, or other areas where diverse data and intelligent systems shape our world.

- #### Human Track – "The Human Lens"
Submit a photo you’ve taken that captures a real-world moment reflecting the challenges or promises of multimodal AI in our lives, communities, or environment.

**Eligibility**: If you are selected as a winner, you will need to provide a UK postal address for prize delivery and a UK contact number in case of delivery issues. Prizes will be delivered via Royal Mail registered postal service. We only request postal and contact details **after selection** and will use them solely for prize delivery. All personal data will be deleted after delivery is complete. 

**Note**: We define Multimodal AI broadly as the integration of any two or more types of data, not limited to texts and images. An individual may submit one image per track (maximum two images in total).
