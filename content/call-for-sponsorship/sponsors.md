Sponsorship opportunities are now available for Third Workshop on Multimodal AI (MultimodalAI’25), taking place on 16–17 September 2025 at the Barbican Centre, London. We expect over 200 in-person attendees from research, industry, and applied domains.

Multimodal AI integrates diverse types of data—text, images, sound, time series, graphs, and more—rapidly transforming how we engage with information and technology. Following two successful one-day workshops, this year’s event will significantly expand in scope, scale, and visibility. The workshop will gather researchers and practitioners from AI, data science, and related scientific and applied domains to discuss challenges, share innovative solutions, explore future collaborations, and strengthen the UK’s growing multimodal AI community.

Hosted by the UK Open Multimodal AI Network (UKOMAIN)—a £1.8 million EPSRC Network Plus project—MultimodalAI’25 will feature:
Keynote presentations by leading experts
- Community pitches, talks, and posters
- Engaging panel discussions and a photo competition
- Valuable funding and policy briefings
- A pre-workshop mini-hackathon (15 September)
- Travel bursaries and volunteering opportunities to support participant inclusion

Prizes will be awarded for outstanding talks, pitches, posters, and photos.

We believe your organisation’s mission aligns with the goals of MultimodalAI’25 and would benefit from the visibility, connections, and talent engagement our event provides.

We offer three sponsorship tiers — Gold (£3,500), Silver (£2,000), and Bronze (£1,000) — with benefits including:

- Free workshop registrations (2–6 depending on tier)
- Logo display on website and digital programme
- Opportunities for short talks or pitches
- Sponsor booths and banner placement
- Acknowledgement during opening and closing remarks
- Prize recognition and more

We are also happy to explore custom packages tailored to your needs, such as sponsor-branded materials or giveaways.
