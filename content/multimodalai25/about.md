You are warmly invited to join the Third Workshop on Multimodal AI (MultimodalAI'25), taking place on **16 and 17 September 2025** at the **Barbican Centre**, **London**, **EC2Y 8DS**. This workshop will be an in-person-only event, preceded by a **mini-hackathon** on **15 September** at the **Torrington Place (1-19)**, **London**, **WC1E 7HB**.

Multimodal AI integrates diverse types of data, such as text, images, and sound, swiftly revolutionising how we interact with technology and information. Following two successful workshops, MultimodalAI’25 will gather researchers and practitioners from AI, data science, and various scientific and applied domains. The workshop aims to discuss challenges, share innovative solutions, explore future collaborations, and further build our vibrant multimodal AI community.

Hosted by the UK Open Multimodal AI Network (UKOMAIN)—a £1.8 million EPSRC Network Plus project—the event features keynote presentations from leading experts, community pitches, talks and posters, engaging panel discussions, a photo competition, and valuable funding and policy briefings. Prizes will recognise outstanding pitches, talks, posters, and photos. Additionally, we offer travel bursaries and volunteering opportunities to support participants.

Join this interdisciplinary gathering to connect, collaborate, and drive forward multimodal AI research and development.  For further details, follow us at https://www.linkedin.com/company/ukomain.
