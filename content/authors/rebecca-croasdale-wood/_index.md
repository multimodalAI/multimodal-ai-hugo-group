 Biography: Rebecca is an innovative leader responsible for the implementation of novel and disruptive in silico technologies to increase the speed of discovery and quality of biologics therapeutics. She is an experienced antibody engineer with structural biology expertise and was co-inventor of the CrossMab technology that is now leading the way in approvals for multispecific antibody therapeutics. She has authored 17+ patents in the field of antibody engineering.

**MultimodalAI'25 Keynote Title:** Integrating AI into biologics discovery workflows

**MultimodalAI'25 Keynote Abstract:** The biologics landscape is rapidly changing with the number of AI-enabled biologics in pre-clinical and clinical stages increasing, this change is driven by the increase in enterprise software solutions to capture and store data, augmented discovery workflows, improvements in machine learning technology and advances in computing power. 

Augmented biologics discovery has the potential to revolutionize biologics discovery we will present current in silico biologics design and optimisation technologies, with a focus on our internal efforts to benchmark the impact of combining novel in silico technologies with our existing biologics discovery platforms.
