**Biography:** Hoifung Poon is the General Manager of Real-World Evidence at Microsoft Research and an affiliated faculty at the University of Washington Medical School. He leads biomedical AI research and incubation, with the overarching goal of structuring medical data to optimize delivery and accelerate discovery for precision health. His team and collaborators are among the first to explore large language models (LLMs) and multimodal generative AI in health applications, producing popular open-source foundation models such as PubMedBERT, BioGPT, BiomedCLIP, LLaVA-Med, BiomedParse, with tens of millions of downloads. His latest publications in Nature and Cell features groundbreaking digital pathology and spatial proteomics foundation models such as GigaPath and GigaTIME. He has led successful research partnerships with large health providers and life science companies, creating AI systems in daily use for applications such as molecular tumor board and clinical trial matching. His prior work has been recognized with Best Paper Awards from premier AI venues such as NAACL, EMNLP, and UAI, and he was named the "Technology Champion" by the Puget Sound Business Journal in the 2024 Health Care Leadership Awards. He received his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington, specializing in machine learning and NLP.

**MultimodalAIForum'26 Keynote Title:** Towards Virtual Patient: AI for Accelerating Medical Discovery

**MultimodalAIForum'26 Keynote Abstract:** Today, medical discovery advances one clinical trial at a time, each taking years to execute and often costing $100 million or more. As we enter the era of precision health in which we recognize that “one size doesn't fit all” and thus try to tailor treatments for each individual, continuing on today's discovery processes is clearly not sustainable. The confluence of technological advances and social policies has led to rapid digitization of multimodal, longitudinal patient journeys, such as electronic health records (EHRs), imaging, and multiomics. Our overarching research agenda lies in advancing multimodal generative AI to learn the language of patients and create a virtual patient world model as digital twin for forecasting disease progression and treatment response. This enables us to synthesize population-scale real-world evidence from hundreds of millions of patients and accelerate medical discovery through AI-powered virtual clinical trials, in deep partnerships with real-world stakeholders such as large health systems and life sciences companies.
