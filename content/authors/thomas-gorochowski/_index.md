Biography: Thomas E. Gorochowski is a Professor of Biological Engineering in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol and currently holds a Royal Society University Research Fellowship. Coming from a background in computer science, he has since transitioned into the area of bioengineering, working across industry as a Marie Curie Fellow at DSM in the Netherlands and academia as part of the Synthetic Biology Centre at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. In 2016, he founded the Biocompute Lab at the University of Bristol (www.biocomputelab.org), which aims to better understand the computational architecture of biological systems to enable the more rational reprogramming of biology. He currently leads the national UKRI CYBER Engineering Biology Mission Award to help de-risk environmental applications of synthetic biology and is the Bristol lead for the EPSRC EEBio Programme Grant that aims to improve the robustness of synthetic biology through the integration of control engineering approaches.
