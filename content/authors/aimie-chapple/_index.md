Biography: A proven global business leader, with 30+ years of experience in consulting and business operations. Have worked with client organisations in the US, Europe and Asia planning and implementing large scale change programmes, and similarly implemented internal programmes across the globe; focused on leading large scale customer experience organisations to deliver credible services to key stakeholders. 

As the VP Operations at UCL (University College London) these experiences come together to support our key stakeholders (students, faculty, researchers, partners, our community) across the University ecosystem to deliver the UCL Vision:

“Our distinctive approach to research, education and innovation will further inspire our community of staff, students and partners to transform how the world is understood, how knowledge is created and shared and the way that global problems are solved.”

Aimie also serves as a Non-Executive Director for LTG and as an occasional start-up coach, focused on leadership, digital, innovation, leadership, sustainability, wellness and business improvement.
