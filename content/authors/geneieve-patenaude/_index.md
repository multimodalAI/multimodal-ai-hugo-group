Geneieve's mission is to ease access to planetary-scale nature and climate intelligence to address global challenges. Earth Blox (SaaS) is a code-free nature and climate analytics solutions builder. It works like LEGO: users build their solutions using modular blocks that replace complex algorithms. 

She is leading a multi-award winning team. She has won Tech Nation (Net Zero, Sept 2021), Unlocking Ambitions (Sept 2021), Scottish Edge in 2020 (UK's biggest funding competition for entrepreneurs), Converge Challenge and have been awarded several highly competitive grants by the UK's Innovation Agency (ICURE and Smart awards from InnovateUK) to commercialise our innovative technology. To spearhead Earth Blox, I have received a Royal Society of Edinburgh enterprise fellowship (@TheRSE is Scotland's national academy of science and letters). 

During her academic career, She has led large international projects (>£13M in research income), published widely including in Nature and as contributing author to Nobel Prize Winning IPCC (GPG LULUCF). She has co-founded and directed (NXD) Carbomap Ltd. and acted as consultant for Ecometrica Ltd. These experiences have made her acutely aware that the power of Earth Observation remains in the hands of the few (coders and Earth Observation experts).  

With these insights, her mission as CEO of Earth Blox is expand to the power of satellite and Earth Observation intelligence to drive sustainability.
