**MultimodalAI'25 Keynote Title:** AI-Renewed: Transforming offshore renewables with multimodal intelligence 

**MultimodalAI'25 Keynote Abstract:** The offshore renewable energy industry is entering a new era where artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a tool, but a transformative force across the entire lifecycle of renewable energy assets. From enhancing device design, accelerating consenting of new developments, to streamlining operations and maintenance, AI is reshaping how we plan, operate, and advance offshore infrastructure.

Here, we explore how AI has impacted wind energy by tracking its evolution from unimodal machine learning models, used in condition monitoring and document intelligence, to the emerging frontier of multimodal AI. These next-generation systems aim to extract deeper insights by combining diverse data sources such as sensor streams, geospatial imagery, and operational documentation.

Through real-world examples and visionary use cases, weâ€™ll uncover how multimodal AI is helping accelerate environmental monitoring to achieve faster regulatory approvals, enhance predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection, and enable holistic lifecycle planning and circularity in offshore assets.
