Biography: Dr Anna Barnes is an HCPC-registered Clinical Scientist in the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences at King’s College London, Director of the King's Technology Evaluation Centre, joint head of Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, London and the President of IPEM.

She has been involved with IPEM throughout her career. Dr Barnes was one of the first two IPEM trainees in Scotland in 1993, specialising in biomedical engineering and equipment management. She went on to have a career in medical imaging, graduating with a PhD in 1999 from the University of Glasgow followed by two Fellowships at New York University and Columbia University, focusing on neuroimaging and statistical analysis.

Dr Barnes then pursued a research fellowship at the University of Cambridge Brain Mapping Unit before joining University College London Hospital nuclear medicine department as the Lead Clinical Scientist for the newly installed Siemens mMR Biograph PET MRI scanner. During this time, she was awarded two NIHR research fellowships to validate, evaluate and deploy imaging biomarkers in oncology and was appointed Chief Healthcare Scientist for the South-East for NHS England. Her volunteer roles at IPEM have included Vice President External, Vice President Academic and President Elect, before becoming President.
