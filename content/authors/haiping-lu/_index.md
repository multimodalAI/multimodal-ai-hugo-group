I am a Professor of Machine Learning, Head of AI Research Engineering, and AI Strategy Lead at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs), the Turing Academic Lead, and [Insigneo](https://insigneo.org/) Research Director for Healthcare Data / AI, the University of Sheffield. I am also the Machine Learning Theme Lead for Sheffield in the [N8 Centre of Excellence in Computationally Intensive Research](https://n8cir.org.uk/) and the lead organiser of the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)'s interest group on [Meta-learning for multimodal data](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/meta-learning-multimodal-data) (welcome to [sign-up and join](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=p_SVQ1XklU-Knx-672OE-eUxyOQjGdZIurmvwym_4o5UOFhHNkY5WU1RVlczMjNWUVdYTDFDME1VNS4u)). I lead the development of a course on [An Introduction to Transparent Machine Learning](https://pykale.github.io/transparentML/), part of the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk)’s [online learning courses in responsible AI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/funding-call-online-learning-courses-responsible-ai).

My research focuses on *developing translational AI technologies for better analysing multimodal data in healthcare and beyond, particularly multidimensional data and heterogeneous graphs in bioinformatics and medical imaging*. I lead the development of the [PyKale library](https://github.com/pykale/pykale) to provide more accessible machine learning from multiple sources for
interdisciplinary research, officially part of the [PyTorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/).

I serve as an Associate Editor of [IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5962385), [IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/aboutJournal.jsp?punumber=7274989), and [World Scientific Annual Review of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/wsarai). I served as an area chair of IJCAI2021, and a senior program committee member of IJCAI and AAAI since 2018. I was a recipient of a [Turing Network Development Award](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/turing-network-development-awards-call), an [Amazon Research Award](https://ara.amazon-ml.com/recipients/#2018), an [AAAI Outstanding PC Member Award](http://www.aaai.org/Awards/conference.php), a [Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Award](http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/?page=fac_ach&id=80), and an [IEEE CIS Outstanding PhD Dissertation Award](https://cis.ieee.org/getting-involved/awards/past-recipients#OutstandingPhDDissertationAward), and a joint-recipient of a [Wellcome Trust Innovator Award](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/innovator-awards-digital-technologies) and an [NIHR AI in Health and Care Award](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/ai-in-health-and-care-awards-funded-projects-2020/25625#Phase_2_projects). I am a Senior Member of IEEE.

Three of my MSc dissertation students received the [Fretwell-Downing Prize](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/about-department/prizes) for the best MSc Dissertation in their respective years (P. Bai in 2017, H. Xu in 2019, and M. N. I. Suvon in 2022). See the bottom for the [whereabouts](https://haipinglu.github.io/#people) of my past team members.
