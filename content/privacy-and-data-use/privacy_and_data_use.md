UKOMAIN (the UK Open Multimodal AI Network) adheres to the University of Sheffield Privacy Notice for all data collected and stored via University-managed systems, including forms related to events, abstract submissions, volunteering, travel bursary applications, and registrations. These systems may include Google Forms, Google Drive, or other tools under the University’s administration.

In addition, UKOMAIN may collect basic personal information such as your name, email address, affiliation, biography, research interests, or optional photo — for example, to manage mailing lists (e.g. via Google Groups), build community interest groups, or feature participant profiles on our website. Any such data will only be collected and used with your explicit consent, for purposes directly related to UKOMAIN’s events, communications, and community development.

We do not share your data with third parties outside the network, and access to your data is limited to organisers or administrators for relevant purposes only.

If you have questions or concerns about how your data is used in UKOMAIN activities, please contact us at ukomain.contact@gmail.com.
