The rapid expansion of biomedical data from diverse sources presents opportunities to advance healthcare and precision medicine through multimodal AI. Between 2021 and 2024, the increasing number of EMBC papers featuring “multimodal” in their abstracts reflects a growing research trend. Open-source, accessible, reusable, and reproducible tools enable the EMBS and broader research community to build on state-of-the-art developments efficiently and accelerate innovation. This workshop will equip attendees with the knowledge, skills, and tools required to address multimodal AI challenges while promoting open research. The first part of the workshop will focus on open research practices. Participants will engage in interactive Python tutorials using PyKale, a PyTorch-based library for multimodal and transfer learning. These tutorials will introduce essential skills, including version control, automated testing, and configuration management while promoting a standardised pipeline in PyKale: data loading, preprocessing, embedding, prediction, evaluation, and interpretation. The second part will explore multimodal AI techniques for biomedical data analysis, focusing on domain adaptation and multimodal fusion. Participants will work in groups based on their preferences in real-world applications, including cardiovascular disease assessment, brain disorder diagnosis, cancer classification, and drug-target prediction. All examples will follow a standardised file and directory structure, using the pipeline introduced earlier. To ensure hands-on experimentation and collaborative learning, public medical imaging, omics, and molecular datasets such as MIMIC, ABIDE, ROSMAP, BRCA, BindingDB, and BioSNAP will be used. Organisers and speakers will be available to answer questions. Led by the leading experts in multimodal AI and creators of PyKale, this workshop will be highly valuable for researchers and practitioners. Bring a laptop to participate fully.
